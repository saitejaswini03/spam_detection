# 📧 Spam Detection Mail Classifier

This project is a **Spam Detection System** that filters emails into two categories: **Important (Ham)** and **Unnecessary (Spam)**. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and classify incoming emails based on their content.

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Preprocessing of email data (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
- Built using machine learning (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / SVM)
- Accuracy tracking and evaluation using confusion matrix and metrics
- Easy-to-use interface or script

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP)
- Flask / Streamlit (optional for UI)

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a public dataset of labeled emails. Each entry is classified as:

ham: not spam

spam: unwanted promotional or malicious content

Dataset Source: UCI Spam Collection Dataset

📈 Results
Accuracy: 97%+

Precision: 96%

Recall: 95%

F1-Score: 95.5%
